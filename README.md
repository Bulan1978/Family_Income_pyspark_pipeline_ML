# Family_Income_pyspark_pipeline_ML
I found this project in Github and recreated to learn pipeline usage with pyspark. Used apache pyspark with pipeline. The spark, pyspark and java installations were done in the Google Colab drive, which eliminated any requirement of local workstation installation.

The source project which I referred is https://github.com/samarth0174/Build-machine-learning-pipelines-pyspark.

- Challenges faced :

  • preprocessing, building a data processing pipeline, building the logistic regression classifier, model training and evaluation.
  
- Tools / techniques used :

  • Google colab along with pyspark libraries, Pipeline, visualization libraries matplotlib and seaborn.
  
  • Techniques include preprocessing, building a data processing pipeline, building the logistic regression classifier, model training and evaluation.
  
- Model Selection :

  • Logistic Regression evaluated on the basis of metrics like ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve and accuracy check, AOC (area under ROC curve).
    
- Project outcome :
  
  • Machine learning Logistic Regression model to predict adult income prices based on features like age, education and number of family members.
